#If n is odd, print Weird
#If n is even and in the inclusive range of  2 to 5, print Not Weird
#If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
#If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

#Given three integers A, B, and C, determine their sum.
#Your task is to implement the function getSum(A, B, C) which returns the sum A + B + CA+B+C.
#Constraints
# 1 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 100

#ANSWER
